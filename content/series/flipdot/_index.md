Title: "Flipdot"
---

I’ve always wanted to make a project with some flip dot signs. There’s something about the analogue, rattling sound they make as they draw.

So when two meter-long ones came up on eBay for auction I had to have them. For £70 I had a solution that was waiting for
a problem...

I realised it was my grandpa’a 90th coming up, and when I was a child he used to make all sorts of things for me. So I had a bit of a think and decided I wanted to make the world’s least practical pager: capable of displaying approximately X characters simultaneously.
