      <description>I had a bit of a head-scratcher yesterday, as I was writing the Concepts post and found that my slickly auto-generated architecture diagrams were missing from my posts. Navigating to the image source URLs was giving me the big fat 404 on GitHub pages:

 Perfect is the enemy of good
 Knowing I&amp;rsquo;m the kind of person who often lets perfect get the better of me, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get stuck at step one this time.</description>
