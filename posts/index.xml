      <description>I set to work designing a system for monitoring power remotely, and came up with a few iterations.
All of my concepts revolved around a few assumptions:
 A device would be a cheap Raspberry Pi Zero There would be a server that could receive staus updates from multiple devices The server would email users in the case of a power failure  Iteration 1: I&amp;rsquo;m alive My initial ideas revolved around connecting a Raspberry Pi to the house&amp;rsquo;s WiFi network:</description>

      <description>My latest project was inspired when my best friend&amp;rsquo;s mum came to me with a problem:
 A while back there was a powercut in Alderney1, the circuit breaker tripped, and all the food in our freezer spoiled. Can we find something that will warn us if that has happened, so we can send a neighbour round?
 I felt confident that something would already exist, and sure enough a cursory search turned up a couple of products2.</description>

      <description>The problem When I created my CircleCI pipeline in my first post I came unstuck passing the built site from one job to another as a workspace.
This manifested in two ways, where I&amp;rsquo;d made the same mistake in two different jobs.
Deployment issues The deploy job appeared to work correctly, but when I navigated to the site I was greeted with a 404 error:

      <description>Introduction This post is about how I set up this site!
Framework So I wanted a static site generator. You know, the trendy, &amp;lsquo;lightning-fast&amp;rsquo;, modern-web-has-gone-full-circle technology. Because I just want to write some text that people can read, and I can execute a build step without hurting myself.

 Knowing I&amp;rsquo;m the kind of person who often lets perfect get the better of me, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get stuck at step one this time.</description>
