        <p>My latest project was inspired when my best friend&rsquo;s mum came to me with a problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A while back there was a powercut in Alderney<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, the circuit breaker tripped, and all the food
in our freezer spoiled.
Can we find something that will warn us if that has happened, so we can send a neighbour round?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I felt confident that something would already exist, and sure enough a cursory search turned up a couple
of products<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
They worked by plugging into a mains socket, acting as a passthrough for electricity,
but loaded with a SIM card to text predefined numbers if the power failed.
However I was pretty surprised at how pricey they were (£125 and £150), given they looked a bit dated.</p>
<p>The problem was further defined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have two circuit rings in our house, and during the previous powercut one circuit stayed up and
the other tripped.
I don&rsquo;t really want to spend ~£300 because we need two of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point I could feel myself itching to solve this with a signature overengineered solution.
With images of raspberry pi&rsquo;s, cloud databases, email notifications, flying through my head, I tried
to find a <em>quick</em> solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe Alderney electricity board have an API for announcing power failures<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>? ❌</li>
<li>Maybe UPSs already exist that could power a freezer and have in-built notifications<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>? ❌</li>
</ul>
<p>Who was I kidding, by this point my weakness for overcomplicating life had set in. I wanted to try my
hand at this IoT project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a desperate and percipient attempt to stop the inevitable, Dad quickly took me to Spurs to see
Jimmy Greaves score four against Sunderland in a 5-1 win, but the damage had been done, and the six
goals and all the great players left me cold: I’d already fallen for the team that beat Stoke 1-0 from
a penalty rebound.</p>
