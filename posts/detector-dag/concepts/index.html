        <p>I set to work designing a system for monitoring power remotely, and came up with a few iterations.</p>
<p>All of my concepts revolved around a few assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A device would be a cheap <a
  href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">
  Raspberry Pi Zero
</a>
</li>
<li>There would be a server that could receive staus updates from multiple devices</li>
<li>The server would email users in the case of a power failure</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="iteration-1-im-alive">Iteration 1: I&rsquo;m alive</h2>
<p>My initial ideas revolved around connecting the Raspberry Pi to the house&rsquo;s WiFi network:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/_gen/archie/im-alive-context-device.png"
         alt="iteration-1"/> 
</figure>

<ul>
<li>Devices are connected to home WiFi network</li>
<li>Devices send &ldquo;I&rsquo;m alive&rdquo; messages to the server</li>
<li>During a power cut, the devices die and no messages are sent</li>
<li>The server informs users of a failure after a device hasn&rsquo;t been seen for a while</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking about this design caused me concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t much like using internet connectivity as a proxy for power.
I could envisage false positives in cases where the internet failed, or the Pi&rsquo;s WiFi connection failed.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t relish the prospect of getting non-technical users to connect Pi Zero&rsquo;s to their home network.
It would likely require a setup step where the Pi presents itself as an <a
  href="https://iot.stackexchange.com/a/658"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">
  access point
</a>
.
Then would it need a reset button? Urgh.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="iteration-2-im-dead">Iteration 2: I&rsquo;m dead</h2>
<p>I really preferred to have a convincing &ldquo;power lost&rdquo; message rather than relying on the <em>absence</em> of
receiving &ldquo;I&rsquo;m alive&rdquo;. However this required the Pi to remain powered during a powercut - at least long
enough to send the message.</p>
<p>I found the <a
  href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32954180664.html"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">
  UPSLite
</a>
,
a reasonably-priced, uninterruptable power supply shield designed for the Pi Zero.
It includes a digital signal connected to a GPIO pin that indicates power status, as well as extra
features such as allowing the Pi to interrogate battery capacity/voltage.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/_gen/archie/im-dead-context-device.png"
         alt="iteration-2-device"/> 
</figure>

<p>Ok, so now the Pi can send a &ldquo;power lost&rdquo; message. But if there&rsquo;s been a power cut the router is probably
down too! Fine, lets throw in a <a
  href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075QZQSS1"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">
  small UPS
</a>
 for the
router too.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/_gen/archie/im-dead-context.png"
         alt="iteration-1"/> 
</figure>

<ul>
<li>Devices are connected to home WiFi network</li>
<li>During a power cut the UPSs for the device and router keep both running</li>
<li>The devices send a &ldquo;power lost&rdquo; message to the server</li>
<li>The server sends an email upon receiving a &ldquo;power lost&rdquo; message</li>
</ul>
<p>My concerns with <em>this</em> design were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just because the router is powered, will the local area&rsquo;s internet still be up during a powercut?
Initial research suggested it <em>would</em>
(internet providers would probably have their own generators).
However my use case was <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderney"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">
  &lt;em&gt;Alderney&lt;/em&gt;
</a>

where normal assumptions about infrastructure may not hold true&hellip;</li>
<li>The system still depends on a WiFi connection between the Pis and the router.
I just felt superstious about leaving these devices for long periods of time, unattended,
and relying that they&rsquo;d be connected for these rare, important events.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="iteration-3-im-independent">Iteration 3: I&rsquo;m independent</h2>
<p>This iteration isn&rsquo;t so clever. If you&rsquo;ve read the <a
  href="/posts/detector-dag/introduction/"
  rel="noopener">
  Introduction
</a>

you&rsquo;ll realise that I&rsquo;ve just reinvented the products discussed there for a bit less money.</p>
<p>Well, those guys are running a business on this model, maybe they know what they&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/_gen/archie/independent-context-device.png"
         alt="iteration-3"/> 
</figure>

<ul>
<li>Devices are connected to the internet using a USB dongle loaded with a data SIM</li>
<li>During a power cut the UPSs for the devices keep them running</li>
<li>The devices send a &ldquo;power lost&rdquo; message to the server</li>
<li>The server sends an email upon receiving a &ldquo;power lost&rdquo; message</li>
</ul>
<p>I had reservations about this design too, of course:</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi is &lsquo;free&rsquo; (paid for already), whereas SIM cards introduce a new running cost</li>
</ul>
<p>But what I liked about this was the removal of any configuration steps aside from activating a SIM card.
My end users should be able to plug-and-play.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<h2 id="onwards">Onwards</h2>
<p>Ok, so this post has attempted to justify the design decisions. But let&rsquo;s remember I like things complicated.
So take everything here with a few grains of salt, life tastes better that way&hellip;</p>
